This text file is a list of things that are to be directly
implemented next, in case I stop working on this for a few days
or someone wants to know what needs to be done next.

The list is as follows:

- Player movement seems to be properly replicating.
  Actually validate it and make sure there are good
  helpers in place to handle the websocket opcodes
  before moving on to other opcode handlers.
- Get the player turns working to the most basic level,
  in that only the player who's turn it is can use 
  movement
- Make the multicasts concurrent and not terrible
