<h1>Relic Mercs Game Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Index Of Important Sections</h2>
<a href="#charValidation">Player Character Validation</a><br/>
<h2>What To Write In This Document</h2>
<p>
This document should contain descriptions of gameplay systems,
graphical effects, protocols, user interfaces, how they interact with eachother
and how they should be coded.
This should be a helpful resource to anybody working on this project,
mostly to see what to implement next and how.
</p>
<h2>What is this game?</h2>
<p>
A turn based role playing co-petetive game running in a browser.
The players take turns moving their characters on a map, encountering
events, using their character's skill to deal with the encounters and
making themselves more powerful.
The ultimate goal is to gather information and recover an ancient relic for a 
benefactor, while denying the relic to the other players.
</p>
<h2>How does it start?</h2>
<p>
The players, upon loading into the website, are greeted by a login screen
prompting a playername, player password and game password with a html form.
This associates them with an in-game character.
If they haven't been in the game yet, they are then redirected to
a character creation html form.
They fill in their character details, submit the form and it's validated
before spawning the player on the board and last in the turn order.
</p>
<h3 id="charValidation">Player Character Validation</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Usernames can't be duplicates</li>
    <li>The statistics on the character sheet need to adhere to the rules (prevent cheating)</li>
    <p class="todo"> What more do we need to validate?</p>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>The Game Interface</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A horizontal 3d planar map occupies the center of the screen and allows
        for camera panning and zooming (but no rotation, as it would only be confusing).</li>
    <li>The portraits for all the participants in the game should be shown
in the top left, along with vital statistics.</li>
    <li>The player should be able to open their own and other character's statistics by
        clicking on the portraits.
        This should open a popup in the middle of the screen listing known statistics</li>
</ul>
